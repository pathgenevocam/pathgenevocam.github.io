To mark the publication of our recent paper, **Colonization and transmission of *Staphylococcus aureus* in schools: a citizen science project**, senior author Dr Andrew Conlan wrote a [post](https://microbiologysociety.org/blog/i-am-not-being-individual-on-me-own-how-do-social-networks-drive-transmission-of-infectious-disease.html) for the Microbiology Society blog.  In it, Andrew provides a background to the project and its findings.
