description: "I’m a postdoctoral fellow in the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control and College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University and now a visiting scholar in the Pathogen Genomics and Evolution Group at the University of Cambridge. My main work during my PhD focused on AMR changes of *Escherichia coli* from livestock during the last 50 years. And I’m currently working on the heavy metal and biocide resistance in *E. coli* and its correlation with AMR. I also work for China Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network for Pet (CARPet) and get involved in related projects such as microbiome of the respiratory/urinary tract in health/infected pets, the changes of microbiome of skin during infection and prediction of AMR of veterinary clinical isolates with machine learning models."
