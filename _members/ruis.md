description: "I am a research associate interested in using genetic sequences to understand pathogen transmission. During my PhD at University College London, I worked to understand the factors that drive norovirus pandemics. Since joining the labs of Andres Floto and Julian Parkhill in Cambridge, my research has focussed on understanding the pathways of *Mycobacterium abscessus* transmission. Through this work, I developed a novel method to reconstruct pathogen mutational spectra and I am currently investigating what we can learn about pathogen ecology, transmission and biology from mutational spectra."
