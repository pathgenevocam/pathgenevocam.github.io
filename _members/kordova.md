description: "I am a PhD student with a strong interest in machine learning and its use in identifying novel antibiotic resistance mechanisms in the bacterium *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. My research project is co-supervised by Professor Tim Walsh from the University of Oxford. I have previously completed my MSci degree at University College London, where I carried out research under the supervision of Dr. Lucy Van Dorp. My thesis focused on characterising the genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance in the bacteria *Acinetobacter baumannii*. I later joined the research group of Dr. Moritz Treek at The Francis Crick Institute. As a part of my project, I also applied machine learning techniques to the analysis of Perturb-seq data of the parasite *Toxoplasma gondii* and infected human cells to understand host-pathogen interaction. A key aspect of the project was the functional annotation of previously uncharacterised parasite effector proteins."
