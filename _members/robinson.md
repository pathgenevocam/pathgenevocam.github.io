description: "I am a Senior Research Associate with an interest in Streptococcal diseases of horses, namely *Streptococcus equi* and *Streptococcus zooepidemicus*. I graduated with a BSc (Hons) in microbiology and a PhD in molecular microbiology from the University of Sheffield in 1992 and 1996 respectively. Subsequently, I took up a three-year post-doctoral placement at the University of Portsmouth working on transcription factors involved in blood development in *Xenopus laevis*. In 2000 I moved to the Animal Health Trust in Newmarket where I was a senior scientist in the bacteriology research department involved in multiple projects involved in understanding the pathogenicity, genomics and epidemiology of equine streptococci. I co-led projects leading to commercialisation of molecular tests for equine Streptococcal infections, and research leading to the introduction (in 2021) of a vaccine to prevent Strangles caused by *S. equi* in horses. When the Animal Health Trust closed in 2020, I took up my current position in Cambridge using TraDIS technology to investigate how *S. zooepidemicus* binds to the equine respiratory tract and evades host innate immune responses."
