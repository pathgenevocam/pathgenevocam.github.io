description: "I am a post-doctoral researcher interested in understanding how evolutionary processes shape microbial genomes. My work focuses more on method than microbe, aiming to develop statistical approaches and computational tools for the analysis of genetic data in multiple species. After graduating with a BA&Sc in Molecular Biology and Political Science from McGill University in 2012, I moved from Canada to the UK to complete the MPH at Imperial College in 2013. I earned my PhD at Imperial College in 2020, under the supervision of Dr. Xavier Didelot and Dr. Christophe Fraser, for developing methods to perform genome-wide association studies in clonal and recombining organisms. My PhD research culminated in the release of [treeWAS](https://github.com/caitiecollins/treeWAS): the first phylogenetic method for microbial GWAS. As a postdoc in the Parkhill group, my aim is to develop approaches to incorporate non-SNP genetic variation into phylogenetic inference methods in bacteria. In mapping recombination and gene gain/loss events across the clonal frame, we hope to determine whether rates of change in these genetic elements can be reliably estimated. We aim to use these inferences to improve the resolution and temporal calibration of phylogenetic trees in partially-recombinant organisms."
