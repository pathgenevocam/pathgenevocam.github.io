description: "I am a Research Assistant working primarily on bacterial genomics and the microbiome of the respiratory tract. While studying part time at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 2007, I started working in the Sequencing Production team at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. I did my final research project there on the identification of mixed genotype *Plasmodium falciparum* infections using the newly developed Illumina sequencing platform, under the supervision of Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski. In 2008 I took a Research Assistant position with Professor Julian Parkhill on the Pathogen Genomics team, where I went on to focus on novel capsule biosynthesis genes in *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, the human microbiota, and mitigating contamination in low biomass samples. I joined the Department of Veterinary Medicine in 2019."
