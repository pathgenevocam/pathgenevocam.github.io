description: "I am a PhD Student focussing on *Campylobacter* genomics; I have a strong interest in population genomics, microbiology and bioinformatic/statistical approaches to sequence data. I obtained my undergraduate degree in Biomedical Science at The University of Manchester; during my degree, I completed a placement year at QIAGEN, focussing mainly on qPCR development. I then undertook a role as a Data Analyst within Prof. Brown's aDNA laboratory at the Manchester Institute of Biotechnology investigating the domestication and origins of tetraploid wheat using GBS data. I obtained my MPhil at the University of Manchester in Biostatistics in early 2020 working on Bayesian statistics and different approaches to Mendelian randomization. After graduating, I then worked within the Maiden Group at the University of Oxford investigating and characterizing the population structuring of *Neisseria gonnorrhoeae*, focussing mainly on *PorB*."
