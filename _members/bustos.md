description: "I am Veterinarian and I did my Doctorate degree analysing Argentinian *Streptococcus equi* strains in the University of Buenos Aires. As post-doctoral researcher I worked with IgY anti-Salmonella in the National Institution of Agricultural Technology (INTA). I am passionate about veterinary medicine, horses and microbiology. I research and teach infectious diseases in Argentina. My current position is Researcher in the National Council for Scientific and Technical Research (CONICET) working on the study of bacteria with impact on equine health (*Streptococcus equi*, *S. zooepidemicus*, *Rhodococcus equi* and *Salmonella* spp.). I am also Assistant Professor of Infectious Diseases Department of the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and Full Professor of Infectious Diseases Department of the National University of Entre RÃ­os (UNER).I had the opportunity to visit different institutions in other countries learning and collaborating with other researchers such as Dr. Ana Isabel Vela Alonso's team (VISAVET, Complutense University of Madrid) and Andrew Waller's group (formerly the Animal Health Trust). So, I am really excited to be at the University of Cambridge learning about genomic with the Julian Parkhill's group."
