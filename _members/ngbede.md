description: "I am an academic with the Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Federal University of Agriculture Makurdi, Nigeria and currently an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellow with the Microbial Genome Research Group of Professor Ulrich NÃ¼bel at The Leibniz Institute, DSMZ Braunschweig, Germany. My research interest is focused on using genomic tools to understand the dynamics of exchange and spread of resistant bacteria pathogens between humans and animals. Prior, I obtained my Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and PhD degrees from Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, Nigeria investigating antibiotic resistance in Enterococci from animal sources. I joined the Pathogen Genomics and Evolution Group of Professor Julian Parkhill as a visiting researcher to work on a collaborative project investigating non-typhoidal *Salmonella* recovered from animals and humans in Makurdi, Nigeria. I aim at utilizing the opportunity of this visit to expand my knowledge in microbial genomics, gain hands-on-experience on the use of bioinformatic tools to investigate emergence and spread of resistant pathogens and foster collaborations. My visit is supported by the Cambridge-Africa Alborada Research Fund and the Microbiology Society, Research Visit Grant."
