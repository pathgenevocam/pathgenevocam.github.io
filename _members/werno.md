description: "I am a medical microbiologist working at Canterbury Health Laboratories (CHL) in Christchurch, New Zealand. CHL is a tertiary hospital laboratory diagnosing a wide range of bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic diseases. We are in the process of adding whole genome sequencing to our array of diagnostic methods, especially for hospital outbreak investigations and extensive genomic characterisation of phenotypically interesting bacterial pathogens of high clinical impact. I will spend my one month sabbatical with the Pathogen Genomics and Evolution group to learn the basic bioinformatic tools to analyse and characterise 10 strains of *Streptococcus dysgalactiae* subsp. *equisimilis* from Christchurch patients with severe clinical presentation."
