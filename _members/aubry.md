description: "I'm currently a doctoral candidate in the Institute for Microbiology and Epizootics at the Freie Universität Berlin and am doing my project in collaboration with the Pathogen Genomics and Evolution Group of the University of Cambridge. My main focus is on *Streptococcus* canis, an emerging pathogen which mainly affects dogs by causing skin infection. I am currently working on population genetics for *S.canis* where we will identify particularly interesting groups which we will then test for new virulence factors. This will be done with Transposon Directed Insertion-site Sequencing (TraDIS) in the context of blood and skin invasions. Before this, I received my Master's degree in Microbiology from the Université de Clermont-Ferrand after having submitted my thesis on *Salmonella typhimurium* bacterial persistence in the context of macrophage invasion."
