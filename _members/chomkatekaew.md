description: "I am a PhD student focusing on *Burkholderia pseudomallei*, an environmental bacterium and the causative agent of a deadly infectious disease called 'Melioidosis', which is endemic in many low- and middle-incomes countries.  This bacterium is an intrinsically drug resistant pathogen and potential bioweapon. The antibiotic treatment options for melioidosis are limited and the mortality rate from acute melioidosis remains high at about 40% in Thailand. I am co-supervised by Claire Chewapreecha, a Wellcome International Intermediate Fellow at MORU (Thailand), and Prof. Julian Parkhill at Department of Veterinary Medicine.  For my PhD, I will focus on the evolution of antibiotic resistance mechanisms in *B. pseudomallei*, including their prevalence, dissemination, adaptive strategies across laboratory, environmental and clinical settings."
