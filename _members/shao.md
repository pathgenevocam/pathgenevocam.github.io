description: “I’m currently a joint PhD student at University of Cambridge and China Agricultural University, co-supervised by Prof. Julian Parkhill and Prof. Yang Wang. My research primarily focuses on bacterial pathogen evolution and the mechanisms driving the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes. I utilize bioinformatics approaches, integrating genomics with machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, to investigate pathogens such as *Escherichia coli*, *Salmonella*, *Campylobacter* and *Enterococcus*. Additionally, I am interested in metagenomics, particularly the respiratory microbiome of dogs and pathogen detection methods for companion animals. I’m always keen to engage in collaborative projects.”
