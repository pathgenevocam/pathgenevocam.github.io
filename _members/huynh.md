Prof. Ngo Thi Hoa from Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU-Vietnam) and Prof. Julian Parkhill at the Department of Veterinary Medicine. My DPhil will focus on the zoonotic transmission and persistent colonisation with colistin-resistant bacteria in different chicken farming systems in Vietnam"
