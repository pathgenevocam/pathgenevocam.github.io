description: "I am a Research Fellow at the Bacteriology Department of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research - University of Ghana (UG). I completed my PhD in molecular cell biology of infectious diseases in 2020 at the West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens â€“ UG. As a young scientist, and a trained molecular epidemiologist, I have developed a keen interest in mycobacterial diseases over the past decade. My career vision and aspirations are to use the invaluable knowledge and skills gained to lead a research team to explore mycobacterial diseases of public health importance focusing on understanding transmission dynamics and detecting epidemics using genomic epidemiology as well as computational biology approaches to aid their management and control. Bacterial pathogens of prior interest to me include *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, *M. ulcerans* and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). I joined the Parkhill group in the Department of Veterinary Medicine in July 2022 to establish collaborations and work on a collaborative research project that seeks to build capacity in computational biology for exploring the clinical relevance of zoonotic tuberculosis and NTM towards future control tools development and drug resistance monitoring. The collaborative project is supported by early career research funders - Africa Research Excellence Fund (AREF) and Cambridge-Africa ALBORADA fund. I look forward to a fruitful collaboration to help advance my research career."
